# Affine variety
- algebraically closed infinite field ${tex`k`}
- ${tex`S\subseteq k[X_0,\dots,X_n]`}

define the vanishing set of ${tex`V(S)`} as
$$
V(S)=\{(x_0,\dots,x_n)\in k^{n+1}\mid \forall f\in S, f(x_0,\dots,x_n)=0\}
$$
and an affine variety $X$ is the same as algebraic set for some subset $S\subseteq k[X_0,\dots,X_n]$

we will see that $X \Longleftrightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R(X))$
